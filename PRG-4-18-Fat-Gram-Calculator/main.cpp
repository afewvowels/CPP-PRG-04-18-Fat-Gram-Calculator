//  Write a program that asks for the number of calories and fat grams in a food. The
//  program should display the percentage of calories that come from fat. If the calories
//  from fat are less than 30 percent of the total calories of the food, it should also display
//  a message indicating that the food is low in fat.
//
//  One gram of fat has 9 calories, so
//  Calories from fat = fat grams * 9
//  The percentage of calories from fat can be calculated as
//  Calories from fat / total calories
//
//  Input Validation: Make sure the number of calories and fat grams are not less than 0.
//  Also, the number of calories from fat cannot be greater than the total number of calories.
//  If that happens, display an error message indicating that either the calories or fat grams
//  were incorrectly entered.
